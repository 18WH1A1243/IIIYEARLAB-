angular(client side)
it is a framework
it is a predefined technology  to reduce burden of programmer
angular deals with json format
json(key-value pair)-to transfer only data according to client request
rest api-will give response as json format- with java(bcoz we worked with dao)
node js is server side
first we have to start with server side then client side
angular will prepare json obj and sends to rest api in json format
only data comes to client side
